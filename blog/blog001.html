        <h1>Social Engineering: Stay Safe Online</h1>
        <p class="intro">Posted by Home-Tech Indiana on June 20, 2025</p>

        <p>We rely on our devices for everything from staying connected to managing daily tasks. As we embrace technology, scammers have learned to use increasingly sneaky tactics to exploit trust and steal personal information, making online safety more important than ever. We share and store more and more information online, so how do you keep that information from getting into the wrong hands?</p>

        <h2>Social Engineering</h2>
        <p>If you grew up in the 1990s and 2000s, you probably heard the term ‘social engineering’. In grade-school, many of us were taught to be aware of cybercriminals trying to manipulate us into sharing sensitive information, like passwords or bank details, by pretending to be someone trustworthy. These attacks exploit human psychology and remain prevalent today. We still receive the occasional fake phone call or malicious ‘tech-support’ call, interspersed with more common tactics such as phishing emails and fake search results.</p>

        <p>Spotting social engineering can save you from a costly mistake. Watch for these red flags:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Urgent or Threatening Messages:</strong> Emails or calls demanding immediate action, like “Your account is locked!” or “Pay now to avoid penalties.”</li>
            <li><strong>Suspicious Sender Details:</strong> Emails from odd domains (e.g., “support@bank0famerica.com” instead of “bankofamerica.com”).</li>
            <li><strong>Requests for Sensitive Info:</strong> Legitimate companies, like your bank or internet provider, won’t ask for passwords or Social Security numbers via email or phone.</li>
            <li><strong>Too-Good-to-Be-True Offers:</strong> Free gift cards or deals that require clicking a link or sharing personal details.</li>
            <li><strong>Impersonation:</strong> Someone claiming to be from a trusted organization, (such as Microsoft) but their story doesn’t add up.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Protecting yourself online is easier with a few smart habits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Verify Before You Trust:</strong> If you get a call or email, don’t click links or share info. Contact the organization directly using a trusted phone number or website.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Strong, Unique Passwords:</strong> Create complex passwords and avoid reusing them. A password manager can help.</li>
            <li><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> Add an extra layer of security to your accounts, like a code sent to your phone.</li>
            <li><strong>Pause and Think:</strong> Scammers rely on urgency. Take a moment to assess any request before acting.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep Software Updated:</strong> Regular updates to your devices and antivirus software protect against vulnerabilities scammers exploit.</li>
            <li><strong>Educate Your Family:</strong> Share these tips with loved ones, especially seniors or kids who may be less familiar with online scams.</li>
        </ul>
