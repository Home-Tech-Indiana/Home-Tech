            <h2>Warm Weather Alert!</h2>
            <p class="post-date">Posted on June 22, 2025</p>
            <p>Summer is here and it feels like Indiana recently relocated to Venus.</p>
            <p>As summer temperatures soar, your devices—laptops, phones, and hard drives—are at risk. Modern devices utilize something called flash memory. For you, this means your phone can hold a lot of pictures and videos without any moving parts.</p>
            <p>Flash isn’t perfect though. Extreme heat can lead to serious performance issues or even permanent data loss. To keep your tech and precious pictures safe, keep your devices cool! Don’t use laptops outdoors unless necessary, and never leave devices in hot cars or direct sunlight! Regularly clean dust from vents and fans to maintain airflow (we can do this if you want).</p>
            <p>Remember that a cool device is a happy device!</p>
